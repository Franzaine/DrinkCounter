# Drink Counter

Example app that allows the host of a party to keep track on the number of free drinks that the
guests get. Hold the "add party person"-button while tapping a guests implant (or card) to add
that person to the list with the pre-decided number of drinks avaiable. Whenever a drink is
ordered make sure to tap their implant to decrease the number of drinks still available to the
guest. Made for Ã–redev 2015
